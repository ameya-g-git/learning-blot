# How to Get a Blot

> Blot is not released yet and this criteria is still in flux. If you want to get an early start and help shape what it means to get a Blot I welcome and appreciate it.

So you just found out about this cool robotic drawing machine which you can build yourself, but how can you get one.

# 1) Make a unique piece of generative art

The first step is to make some generative art like that seen in [the gallery](https://blot.hackclub.dev/gallery).

You can learn how to use the editor and make art by following some of [these guides](https://blot.hackclub.dev/guides).

Some criteria your art needs to meet:

- Your artwork must be [figurative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figurative_art)
  - That means it must draw inspiration from depicting a real life thing.
- Your art program must be able to produce multiple versions of the piece.
  - You should be able to adjust a parameter to make another version of your artwork.
  - To demonstrate this **submit 3 snapshots**.
- For examples of meeting above criteria check out
  - [Leaf](https://blot.hackclub.dev/editor?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackclub/blot/main/art/leaf-leo/index.js)
  - [Fishdraw](https://github.com/LingDong-/fishdraw)
- Drawable by the machine.
  - That means the lines can not be too dense.
  - It should fit within the workarea.
- You need to make your own original piece.
  - You can't just copy an existing piece of art and mess with the numbers.
  - That being said you can take inspiration from other art and remix a few pieces together.

# 2) Make a PR with your original artwork

Once you have made some art you can make a pull request (PR) onto this repo with that program.
These are the steps you need to take to make a PR.

## 2.1) Download your program

- Hover over `download`
- Click `js`

## 2.2) Place your program in a folder with at least 3 snapshots

- Create a folder called `{yourArtworkName}-{yourName}`.
- Inside that folder create a `snapshots` folder with **at least 3 screenshots** of your work.
- Place the code for your artwork in an `index.js` file.

The directory structure can be seen below:

## 2.5) Make a PR

- On your fork's page, click on "Contribute"
- Select "Open Pull Request"
- Click "Create Pull Request"
- Name your pull request with the name of your directory (`{yourArtworkName}-{yourName}`)
- In the body, describe your artwork and your experience coding
- Please add an image of your artwork to the pull request.
- Click "Create Pull Request"

Your PR will be reviewed by people in the BLOT community. We aren't evaluating it based on style
we're looking to see if you put effort and creativity into your work.
Don't worry if this is the first program you have ever written, if you worked hard (at least ~5 hrs) and are proud of the result then it's probably good.
If you are an experienced programmer then we challenge you to show us how nice generative art can be.
Can you make a piece [like](lingdong) [the](zancan) [masters](someone else).

# 3) Fill out the order form

Once your PR is merged we'll give you a link to fill out an order form so we can send you the parts for your machine.

# 4) Build your blot

Once you get your machine build it and have it make your art.
Your fabricated piece will become your ticket to a very special event we are planning next summer.
