# learning-blot

hi! big fan of the blot project, parametric math is such an interesting field to me and i love seeing the creativity that can be expressed just through a couple of math functions

as i'm learning blot, ill be putting all my stuff in this repository for people to view and maybe use! i know i'll be using a couple of the functions i'm making in my final piece to push to the official blot repository!

big big thanks to geschmit for the blot.d.ts file, makes coding this in vscode much easier, and big thank you to hack club in general for holding this initiative! love the community!
