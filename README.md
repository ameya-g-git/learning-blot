# learning-blot

hi! big fan of the [blot](github.com/hackclub/blot/) project, parametric math is such an interesting field to me and i love seeing the creativity that can be expressed just through a couple of math functions

as i'm learning blot, ill be putting all my stuff in this repository for people to view and maybe use! i know i'll be using a couple of the functions i'm making in my final piece to push to the official blot repository!

big big thanks to [geschmit](https://github.com/geschmit) for the [blot.d.ts](https://github.com/geschmit/blotfont/blob/main/blot.d.ts) typechecking file, makes coding this in vscode much easier, and big thank you to [hack club]([url](https://github.com/hackclub/)) in general for holding this initiative! love the community!

## star
to get my feet wet with the api, i decided to first create a spirograph star generator. this was pretty simple, some elementary trig and bam a working star generator, feel free to use this in your project, layer them on top of one another to create some cool shapes! here's just a couple simple ones i made, they can get really crazy if you mess around with the right parameters!
